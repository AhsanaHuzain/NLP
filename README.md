NLP: Text classification

This repository contains an implementation of text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project focuses on emotion classification in text data, utilizing models like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes steps for data preprocessing, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, followed by feature extraction using the bag-of-words model. The models are trained, evaluated, and compared based on accuracy score metrics. The repository provides the necessary code, datasets, and instructions to replicate the process, making it an ideal resource for text classification tasks.
